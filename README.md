A sleek Pomodoro Technique web app for the modern dog-person.

* I set out to create a functional web application to assist in productivity. I am employing a basic version of the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), with 25-minute "work" sessions separated by five-minute "break" sessions.

* As a twist, I have a modal open after the completion of such a session. The modal features three random dog images/gifs, as well as some descriptions of information on a randomly chosen breed. For this, I utilized the Fetch API and the wonderful [TheDogAPI](https://www.thedogapi.com/).
