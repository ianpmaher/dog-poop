A sleek Pomodoro Technique web app for the modern dog-person.

Functional deployment: [https://dog-pomodoro.netlify.app/](https://dog-pomodoro.netlify.app/)

* I set out to create a functional web application to assist in productivity. I am employing a basic version of the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), with 25-minute "work" sessions separated by five-minute "break" sessions.

* As a twist, I have a modal open after the completion of such a session. The modal features three random dog images/gifs, as well as some descriptions of information on a randomly chosen breed. For this, I utilized the Fetch API and the wonderful [TheDogAPI](https://www.thedogapi.com/). 

Technologies used:
* I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (with the **Fetch API**) to create my site. 
* I used CSS to stylize the website for mobile, tablet, and desktop usage, with *mobile responsiveness* thanks largely to the wonder of **FlexBox**. 
* I used Fetch to refresh (and allow the user to refresh) the dog facts and pictures that greet the user. For this, I used the [TheDogAPI](https://www.thedogapi.com/). 
* I used a combination of CSS and JavaScript to enable the modal functionality without utilizing the :modal pseudo-class or dialog box of HTML.
* I utilized only Vanilla JavaScript for functionality.

Room for Improvement: 
* Improve the visual flair of the website. I wanted to keep it simple visually, so I tried to avoid making the layout too busy. 
* However, the CSS animation to flip the seconds element does add quite a bit, and having some other animated elements would be great to add in the future. 
* On learning more JavaScript techniques, I would also love to add more of a flow to the timers, with the user being prompted to take a break with the defaulting to the 5 min timer, for example.
